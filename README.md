# Game_Backlog_System

This system was developed to help with backlogging several video games for several different consoles.
How this works is a user logs into the system or registers and then logs in.
The user is taken to a screen where there are several options to choose from.
These include adding a new console type and name or a game, updating a console or a game, deleting a console or game, adding games from a console to a text file, adding consoles to a text file and addings all games to a text file.
The types of the consoles and games can also be shown.
The times can also be changed as to when either the game or the console were lasted played. 
If an admin an accoutn button is available.
From there accounts can be edited or deleted.

This was not developed for a college project but rather out of interest in the idea. 
The application is a standalone java application. 
The database is also with the code of this project and is called gamebacklog.sql. 
This means if the code is downloaded a demo can be done for the application itself.
